## Getting Started

With Codespaces (or another environment supporting devcontainers):
3. Run `deno task dev` to start the development server

Without Codespaces (local VS Code):

1. Install the [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/) runtime.
2. Install the Deno VS Code extension (must be done only after installing Deno runtime).
3. Run `./setup-hooks.sh` to enable pre-commit quality checks
4. Run `deno task dev` to start the development server

The setup script configures Git hooks to automatically run formatting, linting, and type checking before commits.
